All the states an entry can be in:

# exile ui
- File found on disk in base paths, not ignored, not tracked in manifest
 -> UNTRACKED file. Can be pushed, ignored
- File found on disk, found in manifest, not ignored, does not match signature
 -> Changed file. Can be pushed, pulled, ignored
- File found on disk, matches signature
 -> Not shown in UI

The data structure passed to the UI is:
{
    "dir_name": {
        "file_name": "UNTRACKED",
        "file_name2": MODIFIED",
        "dir_name2": {
            "file_name": "UNTRACKED",
            "file_name2": MODIFIED",
        }
    }
}
